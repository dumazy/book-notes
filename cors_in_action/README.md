## Notes

### Why I chose to read this book

I've had my share of CORS related issues during React development and other JS projects.
On a specific day, I ran into another issue like this and was explaining it to the client.
I also told him "I'm sorry but I'm not an expert on this.".
That triggered me to find some decent materials on this subject and learn all there is to know about it.

### Definition of CORS

Cross-Origin-Resource-Sharing, or CORS, is a way to execute cross-origin requests in the browser, which are by default blocked by the browser's same-origin policy.

### Questions I hope to have answered after reading this

- Why can't we simply allow all origins to make requests?
- What is the goal of the Same-Origin Policy?
- What are common issues when dealing with CORS?
- Should CORS be restricted to specific domains if there is IP-whitelisting?
