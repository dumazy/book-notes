## Notes

I'll keep my notes in different chapters and their topics.
I won't keep notes about all the topics, just things that I remembered to write about.

### Topics

#### DRY - The evils of duplication

DRY is about duplication of knowledge, of intent, **not** coincidentally have the same lines of code.

I remember reading a good article about this difference:
[Stop trying to be so DRY, instead Write Everything Twice (WET)](https://dev.to/wuz/stop-trying-to-be-so-dry-instead-write-everything-twice-wet-5g33)

It's important to think about the intent before you write a reusable piece of code, because you might get yourself stuck into a certain pattern.

#### Tracer bullets vs Prototypes

Tracer bullets are a sort of coding 'attempts' at making a product work as expected.
They should easily be altered, but are part of the actual project's code.

Prototypes should not be part of the code and should never be moved to it.
It's important to be very clear about this.
Although a prototype might look as a nearly completed product, it is very dangerous to use it as production code.
Always make sure the clients (or managers) are aware that this is throw-away code.

#### Estimating

Keep track of your estimates.
They can (and will) change during the project.
Altering them early will give a clearer view on how long the project will take.

Use correct time scale to define your estimates.
If you say something will take 125 days, people expect you to be quite accurate on it.
When you say 6 months, they won't have the same expectations in accurracy.

The book suggests the following scales:

| Duration | Quote estimate in |
| --- | --- |
| 1 - 15 days | Days |
| 3 - 6 weeks | Weeks |
| 8 - 20 weeks | Months |
| 20+ weeks | Think hard before giving an estimate |


##### PERT 

The book suggests to use the PERT methodology (Program Evaluation Review Technique).
This was mentioned in *The Clean Coder* by Robert C. Martin.

This technique requires you to make estimates for
- Optimistic case
- Most likely case
- Pessimistic case

Then they have a formula to calculate the estimated time of this: `(o + 4m + p) รท 6`.
I should try this technique in my next estimates.

##### I'll get back to you

Be careful giving "coffee machine estimates".
Make sure you know what is expected and let it sink in before giving an estimate.
