## Notes

I'll keep my notes in different chapters and their topics.
I won't keep notes about all the topics, just things that I remembered to write about.

### Topics

#### Tracer bullets vs Prototypes

Tracer bullets are a sort of coding 'attempts' at making a product work as expected.
They should easily be altered, but are part of the actual project's code.

Prototypes should not be part of the code and should never be moved to it.
It's important to be very clear about this.
Although a prototype might look as a nearly completed product, it is very dangerous to use it as production code.
Always make sure the clients (or managers) are aware that this is throw-away code.
